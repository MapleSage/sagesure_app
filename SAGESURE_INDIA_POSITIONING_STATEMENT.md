## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### vs. PolicyBazaar / InsuranceDekho
PolicyBazaar sells insurance (they profit from commission on volume). SageSure India protects insurance buyers (we profit from trust and verification, not transaction volume). We're not a distribution layer—we're the trust layer above distribution.

### vs. Insurance Samadhan / Manual Claims Advocates
Manual claims advocacy doesn't scale (₹2-5L per case, labor-intensive). SageSure automates evidence packaging, ombudsman filing, and timeline tracking (₹500-1K per case via SaaS). We're 10x cheaper and 100x faster.

### vs. Incumbent Insurers' In-House Tools
Insurers are building GenAI tools for their own claims/underwriting. SageSure is multi-insurer, consumer-first, and neutral (not designed to benefit one insurer). We're the independent third party that all parties trust.

### vs. Global InsurTech (Shift, Hyperscience, etc.)
Global InsurTech is built for Western specialty insurance (Marine, Cyber, D&O) with Western regulations and languages. SageSure India is built for India (Hindi/Tamil/Telugu, IRDAI rules, scam patterns unique to India, 1930 integration). We're India-native, not localized.
